/*  
   CONDITION:
      CONDITION is  RIGHT HAND SIDE EXPRESSION
      WHICH EVALUATES TO TRUE OR FALSE.
*/

/*
Fundamental source of condition is a  comparison between
integer or float data.

int m, n;

n > m
n >= m
n < m 
n <= m
n == m
n != m

How to build more complex condition
we can use
logical not (!)
logical and (&&)
logical or (||)
operators to build more complex conditions

int result;

result = ((m > n) && (a<b));

result = (a>b)

result = ((a > b) || (m <n ))

0 && 0
0 && 1
1 && 0
1 && 1

m > n && a <b 

p  q  p && q
0  0  0
0  1  0
1  0  0 
1  1  1

m > n   a < b   (m>n && a<b)
0       0        0
0       1        0
1       0        0 
1       1        1 

a > b && m < n

a is less than or equal to b
and 
m is greater than or equal to n
0

a is less than or equal to b
and
m is less than n
0
